Background After months of increasing tension along the inner-German border, Warsaw Pact commanders expect to receive the word to start combat operations at any time. WP air commanders authorize high speed reconnaissance flights across the border.
Pilots are ordered to get in quickly, gather the required intel- ligence, and return.
Targets The reconnaissance objectives for this mission are rear area units of the Belgian 16th Armored Division. The WP recon flight must attempt to collect intelligence on all four targets: Recon Target Hex HAWK Battery 5303 HQ 5404 Supply 4904 HAWK Battery 5308 Scenario Conditions
● Date: 12 May 1987
● Time of Day: 1030 (Day)
● Detection Level: NATO: A WP: A
● Weather: Clear. Do not roll on the Weather Table.
● Map: Only hexes on/north of hexrow xx10 and on/east of hex column 39xx are in play.
● The Front: NATO side is on/west of 6302-6309-6010.
● Closed Airfields: None
● Inherent AAA/IR SAM Coverage: None
● ISR: Neither player ARIOS
● SEAD: Neither player
● Early Warning: Neither player rolls. All flights set up undetected.
● NATO Air Defense Zone: 2ATAF
● NATO Restriction: The NATO CAP flight must remain within one hex of the Orbit Point unless a WP flight has been detected [10.1] and is in a hex on the NATO side of the Front.
● NATO Zone Limit: The NATO flight may not voluntarily move within two hexes of the Front.
● WP Zone Limit: The WP flight may not voluntarily move west of hex column 43xx.
● Rules of Engagement: The NATO side may not attack the WP Recon flight in this scenario in any way. Instead, they have a list of other tasks to complete to try to chase away the WP flight (see Victory Conditions).
● Setup Order: NATO is first.
NATO Order of Battle Air Setup Air Units and Markers:
● 1 x {2} FGR2, CAP. Aggression Value +1. Set up adjacent to the NATO Orbit Point at Deck altitude.
● 1 x Orbit Point in 4307 Ground Setup Army Ground Units: (15-17 May locations, roll for Gepard capability)
● BE 16th Armored Division Air Defense Units:
● 2 x HAWK C, one each in 5303, 5308. Set up located.
● 1 x EWR unit in 4706. Set up located.
NATO Pilot Quality NA Warsaw Pact Order of Battle Air Setup Air Units and Markers:
● 1 x {2} Su-24MR, Recon. Aggression Value +2. Enter within one hex of 7706 on Turn 1.
● 2 x Dummy Flights Ground Setup Air Defense Units:
● 1 x EWR in 6502. Set up located.
WP Pilot Quality NA Scenario Special Rules 1. This scenario ends at the end of Turn 15. At that point, roll for recovery for all flights that have not yet recovered.
2. WP Photo and Electronic Recon. The WP Recon flight must follow a flight path [8.31]. This path must allow the WP Recon flight to fly within one hex of each of the four target hexes at Medium or lower altitude to collect the required photographic/electronic intelligence. Note that the flight does not have to conduct actual Recon Runs [24.1], it just needs to move within one hex of each recon target.
3. Ignore the following Random Events [21], if rolled: NATO QRA, NATO Flight in Trouble, WP QRA, WP Flight in Trouble, MANPAD Ambush, SEAD Strike.
4. The printed AAA concentrations at Hoxter (4505), Ballenstedt (7306), and Cochstedt (7503) must remain inactive during the scenario.
Victory Conditions There are no victory points in this scenario. Instead, the NATO side wins if it accomplishes the following four tasks: 1. Detection [10.1] and Visual Identification [10.4] of the WP Recon flight.
2. Achieve Full SAM Acquisition [15.21] on the WP flight at the end of two Admin Phases.
3. Conduct a successful BVR air-to-air engagement [11.2] of the WP flight. If the engagement occurs, resolve it as if it were normal BVR air-to-air combat, but the NATO player may not fire any shots.
4. Conduct a successful standard air-to-air combat engagement [11.2] of the WP flight. If the engagement occurs, resolve it as if it were a normal air-to-air combat, but neither player may fire any shots. Treat “Abort” Morale Check results as “Disordered” instead.
If the NATO side accomplishes these four tasks, NATO wins.
Otherwise, the WP side wins.
Note: Players should try this scenario at least twice, once with the WP flight at Medium or High altitude (and faster speed) and once at Deck (lower speed, harder to detect). That will give a feel for the difference between “going high” and “go- ing low” when trying to both get to a target and intercepting flights doing so. In addition, during the second playing of the scenario, players should let the NATO side attack the WP flight in order to further learn the combat rules.
RS2: Operation Boloski Background On the afternoon of 15 May 1987, hundreds of Soviet and East German aircraft takeoff in rapid succession and push toward the border at supersonic speeds. With NATO expecting an opening attack on its airbases, the Warsaw Pact planners instead plan to surprise NATO with a mass fighter sweep in an effort to knock out as many NATO fighters as possible on the opening day of the war. All across central and western Germany, NATO airfields scramble every available fighter aircraft. Massive exchanges of long-range missiles begin as the WP pilots push over the border.
As the huge and confused air battle rages, SAM gunners on the ground must sit and wait to see who survives.

Victory Conditions Standard Victory Points [32.1] are in effect. In addition, the WP player receives 20VP if, at the end of Turn 15, all NATO flights are Disordered, Aborted, Landed, or Recovered off-map prior to the Recovery Phase. Also, if the NATO player shoots down at least four WP aircraft and has a 3:1 or better kill ratio, the NATO player receives an additional 10VP. Use the WP Victory Level Table [32.2].
RS3: First Strike Background Right behind the mass fighter sweep to open the war, Warsaw Pact commanders send in a massive wave of ground attack missions striking critical targets to take advantage of the fading daylight before the ground war kicks off. With WP artillery al- ready pounding front line units, the targets are rear area reserves, headquarters, artillery, and supply centers.
Targets The WP primary targets for this raid are rear area units of West Germany’s army in the 2nd Panzer-Grenadier Division sector of the front. The WP player rolls on the Target Table below until until four different raid targets are designated. At least one Bombing flight must be allocated to each target.

RS4: Opening Rounds Background The battle plan for the 8th Guards Army attack toward Frankfurt requires eliminating the United States 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR) in 24 hours. After raids against SAM sites in the early morning darkness meet with mixed results, numerous daylight raid packages attacking 11th ACR frontline units are scheduled to go in at first light. NATO air forces have spent the night preparing to support the forward ground troops, launch- ing strike missions at daybreak seeking to catch the advancing Soviet troops on the move.

Victory Conditions Standard Victory Points [32.1] are in effect. Do not use the WP or NATO Victory Level Tables [32.2]. Instead, at the end of the scenario, compare both sides’ VP counts. If one side’s total exceeds the other by 10+ VP, that side wins. Otherwise, the scenario is a draw.
RS5: Vertical Envelopment Background Soviet airmobile forces are tasked with vertical envelopment of NATO frontline units. Their objective is to get behind the front and disrupt NATO command and logistics nodes. Warsaw Pact commanders order a daytime massed helicopter raid intended to get behind and isolate the US Army’s 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in the Fulda Gap. WP SEAD aircraft must knock down NATO defenses near the front long enough for the slow-moving helicopters to reach their landing zones.
Targets The WP player must attempt to land flights of Mi-8 helicopters at two Landing Zones. The WP player rolls once on the Landing Zone Table to determine the two Landing Zones. Three flights of Mi-8 transport helicopters must be allocated to each zone.

In an exception to [25.1], the WP player must plot a flight path [8.31] for each Mi-8 flight assigned to a Transport task. This flight path starts in the flight’s setup hex and must end at the designated Landing Zone hex at Deck altitude. Mi-8 flights tasked with Transport must move to follow this path each turn until they reach their Landing Zone hexes. To successfully unload the helicopter assault troops requires an Mi-8 to land [25.1] and remain on the ground, without being destroyed, in its designated Landing Zone hex for two consecutive Movement Phases (including the turn it lands). After unloading, helicopter flights must remain on the ground in the Landing Zone hex.
They may not take off.
2. NATO flights get a +10 on their Morale Check rolls for any engagements against Mi-8s.
3. NATO flights tasked with CAP may conduct Strafe Profile [17.39] air-to-ground attacks on landed Mi-8 helicopter flights. Only one landed flight in a hex may be targeted during each strafing attack. Landed Mi-8 helicopters are Target Profile D.
4. Safe Passage Corridors. The NATO and WP players may each plot one Safe Passage Corridor [15.43].
5. This scenario ends at the end of Turn 20. At that point, roll for recovery for all flights that have not yet recovered.
Helicopters that have not yet unloaded are considered to have returned to the WP side of the Front and recovered safely.
Do not roll for recovery for helicopters that have landed and unloaded.
Victory Conditions Standard Victory Points [32.1] are in effect. In addition, the WP player receives 2VP for every Mi-8 helicopter that lands and successfully unloads at its target Landing Zone hex. He- licopters destroyed on the ground after unloading count for 2VP for NATO, so the WP player must continue to protect the Landing Zone hexes as long as possible. Use the WP Victory Level Table [32.2].
RS6: Sanitized Corridors Background Rather than NATO’s “precision” SEAD concept, WP plans require a “mass” approach that includes extensive chaff laying and jamming efforts combined with artillery and anti-radiation missile barrages. The goal of the WP air forces is to create “sanitized corridors” approximately 50 km wide and 200 km deep to allow follow-up deep strikes into NATO’s rear areas.
On the first full day of the war, Soviet commanders put these plans in motion. The early morning wave of fighter-bombers took down numerous HAWK and Patriot sites. A second wave at midday targets Nike-Hercules SAMs deep in NATO’s rear areas to deepen the corridor.
Targets The WP primary targets for this mission are fixed NATO Nike- Hercules SAMs and their supporting radars in the southern part of the NATO 2ATAF zone. The WP player rolls on the Target Table below until four different raid targets are designated.
Each target hex includes multiple sub-targets (see below) that may be attacked.
Roll Target Hex 1 Nike-Hercules 1605 2 Nike-Hercules 2503 3 Nike-Hercules 1913 4 Nike-Hercules 2612 5 Nike-Hercules 1919 6 Nike-Hercules 2619 7-10 Roll Again Nike-Hercules target hexes include the following sub-targets [15.16], which must be targeted separately.

During the scenario, Nike-Hercules SAMs must turn their radars on, or keep their radars on, in the Admin Phase if able to do so.
2. Nike-Hercules Sites as targets.
● Damage from ARM attacks on Nike-Hercules SAM sites are applied only to the Fire Control Radar sub-target in the hex. Other sub-targets (Launchers, etc.) are not affected by ARM attacks.
● If an Attack Success marker is placed on any sub-target in the hex, check for target damage [18.1] immediately. A Slight damage result on any of the sub-targets suppresses the SAM [18.2]. A Heavy or Total Destruction damage result on any of the three sub-targets in the hex requires the SAM to shutdown for the remainder of the scenario.
● AP/AT Cluster Bomb Units [17.61] and Rockets [17.63] attack the launcher and fire control radar at double strength and the command bunker at one-quarter strength. KMGU [17.66] attack the launcher and fire control radar at triple strength and the command bunker at half strength. Other ordnance types attack sub-targets at normal strength.
3. Tu-16K flights may only carry Kh-28M ARMs. No other ordnance allowed.
4. Pre-Game Chaff Laying. As part of Air Deployment Phase, the WP player may place one bloomed chaff corridor [19.4], on/east of hex column 50xx, it may be up to twenty hexes in length with no more than one 30° “turn.” It remains bloomed throughout the scenario.

RS7: Aerial Blockade Background Taking advantage of good weather and earlier efforts by Warsaw Pact SEAD strikes to suppress NATO SAMs, two large fighter- bomber raids designed to “pin” NATO fighters on the ground go in on the afternoon of the second day of the war. With the initial shock to NATO air defenses that accompanied the start of the war fading, the WP pilots must first fly through heavily defended airspace just to reach the targets.
Targets NATO airfields and air defense sites are the targets of this sce- nario. The WP player rolls on the Target Table below until four different raid targets are designated. Two are allocated to each Deep Strike Raid. Each target hex includes multiple sub-targets that may be attacked.

RS8: Runway Busting Background After multiple raids earlier in the day to suppress NATO air defenses and fighter cover, the final piece of the initial WP air operation sees large bomber aircraft sweep into West Germany to pound NATO bases. However, earlier efforts to suppress SAMs and fighters have not exactly gone to plan, so the Tu-16 Badger and Tu-22 Blinder bombers can expect a warm recep- tion from NATO.

RS9: Nighthawks Background NATO commanders count on the highly classified F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter to take down critical elements of the Warsaw Pact air defense network early in the conflict. On the third night of the war, the men of the shadowy 4450th Tactical Group are ordered to penetrate WP lines and take out SAM sites, radars, and air defense command centers. They get some help in the form of a fighter sweep to attract the attention of WP combat air patrols, but otherwise fly alone into the most dangerous air defense network in the world.
Targets Critical nodes of the WP integrated air defense network in southwestern East Germany are targets for this mission. The NATO player rolls on the Target Table below until six different raid targets are designated. Each F-117 flight must be assigned two of these targets.

● Each F-117 flight is considered a separate “mini-raid” and plots its own flight path [8.31] that allows attacks on each flight’s two target hexes.
● If detected, F-117 flights automatically flip to undetected at the start of the Track Phase.
● SAMs may never obtain Full Acquisition on F-117 flights.
Only Partial Acquisition allowed.
● All WP normal and EWR detection attempts on F-117 flights apply a -2 DRM.

Victory Conditions Standard Victory Points [32.1] are in effect, except raid target VP are assessed as follows: Slight Damage (3VP), Heavy Damage (5VP), Destroyed (8VP). In addition, WP VP are doubled for any damage/cripple/shot down result on an F-117 and no WP VP are awarded for failure to recon the targets. Use the NATO Victory Level Table [32.2].
RS10: Frontal Aviation Background Unlike NATO’s more agile close air support doctrine requiring tight and constant coordination between air and ground forces, Warsaw Pact doctrine for support of ground troops largely re- quires artillery and attack helicopters to strike the enemy’s front line. Fixed wing aircraft of Soviet Frontal Aviation are instead intended to hit rear area NATO units, such as headquarters, ar- tillery, and supply depots. Eager to continue the rapid progress made in the first few days of the war in the Belgian I Corps and German III Corps sectors, WP command sends two large bombing raids to hammer the rear areas in this vital sector in support of a dawn ground attack.
Targets The WP primary targets for this mission are West German and Belgian headquarters, supply depots, missile, and reserve units behind the front. For each Bombing Raid, the WP player selects four targets. They must be HQ, Supply, Missile, and/or Armor units, as found in NATO Ground Setup. At least one Bombing flight must be allocated to each target.

RS11: Red Flag Background NATO air commanders are eager to hit back against the War- saw Pact onslaught, including going deep into East Germany to hit rear area WP airfields, command and control nodes, and second echelon forces. However, they know they first have to significantly degrade the WP integrated air defense network.
US forces in particular have trained this exact mission over and over again at “Red Flag” exercises in the Nevada desert. US F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighters flew the night before and took down some of the most dangerous SAM sites, and now additional strike aircraft roll in near midnight to hit more air defense network targets.

RS12: Second Echelon Forces Background A major element of NATO doctrine in the 1980s was the use of airpower to disrupt and degrade Warsaw Pact second and third echelon forces before they could reach the front line and deploy. After taking serious losses stopping the initial WP at- tacks, NATO commanders want to mass airpower against one of the second echelon divisions of the 1st Guards Tank Army as it approaches the front line. After overnight raids to weaken the WP air defense network in this sector, the complex strike package of escorts, jammers, SEAD, strike, and recon aircraft forms up as bad weather rolls in and heads into what will be a storm of AAA and SAMs.
Targets Elements of the 11th Guards Tank Division are the targets of this scenario. The NATO player rolls on the Target Table below until four different raid targets are designated. At least one Bombing flight must be allocated to each target.

RS13: Night Shift Background NATO tries to take advantage of its more numerous fleet of night-capable aircraft by conducting most of its deep strikes in darkness. Key targets include fuel logistics units in Warsaw Pact rear areas. With advancing WP supply lines getting longer every day, NATO air planners hope that by hitting fuel depots, the entire advance could be stopped. This scenario depicts NATO night raids against supply dumps and HQs for two divisions of the East German 3rd Army that are in contact with elements of the US VII Corps.

RS14: Offensive Counter-Air Background A critical element of NATO’s plan to win the air war is going on the offensive against Warsaw Pact airfields using low-level raids by packages of CAP, SEAD, and strike aircraft. WP com- manders anticipate this approach and disperse many aircraft to remote locations. After weakening the SAM defense network over the first few days of the war, NATO commanders send in two big daylight raids against airfields in the 8th Guards Army sector of East Germany. The NATO commanders hope to knock out critical airfields and several dispersed operating facilities in one lightning-quick strike.
Targets WP airfields and aircraft dispersal sites are the targets of this scenario. The NATO player rolls on the Target Table below until four different raid targets are designated. Two are allocated to each Deep Strike Raid. Each target hex includes multiple sub- targets that may be attacked.

RS15: Search and Destroy Background After earlier raids failed to inflict as much damage as hoped to NATO SAM defenses, Warsaw Pact commanders decide to take a different approach. As a result, the WP pilots must fly the mission just like US pilots did in Vietnam, with lead flights deliberately drawing fire from hidden SAMs so follow-on flights can hit the now-exposed SAM locations.

Due to the unknown location of many NATO SAMs, WP SEAD Raids are assigned Kill Boxes in which they must search for, and attack, SAM, AAA, and EWR units. Within the assigned Kill Box, WP SEAD flights may target as many SAM, AAA, or EWR units as desired but must abort when all air-to-ground and gun ordnance for the flight is expended. SEAD flights may only target SAMs, AAA, and EWR in their raid’s assigned Kill Box and may not attack any other targets on the map (Exception: ARMs may be used to attack SAMs outside assigned Kill Boxes).
The four Kill Boxes for the scenario consist of all full hexes within the designated Kill Box corners (inclusive).
● Kill Box 1: 3502-4902-4910-3510

5. NATO IR SAM/AAA Status. In addition to being placed on the map per [15.44] and [14.62], all NATO IR SAMs and Gepard AAA are placed on the map when a WP flight is within one hex, at Low or Deck altitude, and has a line of sight.
6. Safe Passage Corridors. The NATO player may plot two Safe Passage Corridors [15.43].
7. SEAD Raids. For each raid, determine SEAD aircraft type by rolling once on the USSR SEAD task line on OOB Table I. Roll for ordnance available using OOB Table I. Determine CAP aircraft type by rolling once on the USSR line on OOB Table H. Designate ingress/egress hexes on the east edge. All flights in the raid ingress from the east edge on Turn 1.

RS17: Desantniki Background Soviet war plans emphasize disruption of NATO rear area units and infrastructure through aggressive use of airmobile and airborne operations. Frustrated with the stalemate in the West German III Corps sector, Warsaw Pact commanders order the insertion of a regiment of the elite 76th Guards Airborne Division behind the 2nd Panzer-Grenadier Division area of operations. In order to get the slow-moving IL-76 transports to the target and back, WP tactical aviation units provide a large support force with fighters, defense suppression, and electronic warfare aircraft. These forces will try to create and hold open an air corridor for the paratroopers to traverse.
Targets The WP player rolls on the Drop Zone Table below. The WP player then selects a hex within two hexes of the hex rolled.
This hex is the “target” hex for the IL-76 transports carrying the 76th Guards Airborne Division. The Drop Zone is considered a target hex for the purposes of Raid/Task Planning [8.0]. Also see SSR 3.

For the purposes of Escort Jamming [8.341] and Close Escort [8.343] restrictions, WP Paradrop Raid IL-76 flights are considered Bombing flights.
2. NATO flights get a +10 on their Morale Check rolls for any air-to-air combats with IL-76 flights.
3. Paradrop Raid Flights. The WP player must plot a flight path [8.31] for the IL-76 flights. However, all IL-76 flights must use the same middle section of the flight path. This flight path must pass through the Drop Zone hex. To successfully drop the paratroops, each IL-76 flight must pass through the Drop Zone hex at Deck altitude and at speed 2. The IL-76 flights are restricted to this flight path as if they were Bombing flights.
IL-76 aircraft only Abort [8.4] if Crippled [12.22]. They may continue with their mission if Damaged or Disordered [13.11]. If engaged in Standard air-to-air combat, they must try to disengage [11.41].

Victory Conditions Standard Victory Points [32.1] are in effect. Also, any IL-76 aircraft shot down prior to dropping its paratroopers is automati- cally worth 6VP. Those shot down after dropping paratroopers are worth 3VP. In either case, do not roll for crew bailout. In addition, the WP player receives 1VP for each individual IL-76 aircraft that successfully drops its paratroopers. The WP player earns an additional 1VP for each IL-76 aircraft that successfully drops its paratroopers and recovers safely. Use the WP Victory Level Table [32.2].
RS18: Dance of the Vampires Background Frustrated by NATO’s continued generation of aircraft sorties at a fairly high rate after more than a week of combat, Warsaw Pact commanders order another all-out effort to damage NATO airfields in the central front sector. The WP receives special reinforcements from USSR-based long-range bomber assets, including Tu-16K Badger bombers armed with supersonic AS-6 Kingfish missiles. The WP planners hope that a barrage of these missiles, supported by jammers and SEAD aircraft, will over- come NATO’s defenses and put several bases out of operation.
Targets The WP player rolls on the Target Table below until three dif- ferent raid targets are designated. Three AS-6 flights must be allocated to each target. Each AS-6 missile will randomly attack a sub-target in its target hex. See SSR 2.

WP Pilot Quality USSR: 1 Ace, 2-4 Veteran, 5-10 Regular; GDR: 1 Veteran, 2-4 Regular, 5-10 Trained Scenario Special Rules 1. The AS-6 flights enter the map at High altitude, having been launched off-map by Tu-16 aircraft. They enter visually identified [10.4] and do not use generic flight counters. Plot a full flight path [8.31] for each individual flight as if they were separate raids, except that there is no return from the target and they are limited to two waypoints on the way to the target.
2. For resolving the air-to-ground attack for an AS-6 missile flight, each missile in the flight attacks separately. When an AS-6 flight enters the target hex, randomly select the specific targets by rolling 1d10 for each AS-6 missile: 1-3 Runway, 4-6 Hardened Aircraft Shelters, 7-8 Hangars, 9+ Fuel Storage.
The same target may be selected more than once.
3. Tu-16K SEAD flights may only carry Kh-28M ARMs. No other ordnance allowed.

RS20: Birds of Prey Background The Soviet Union pioneered the idea of armored close air support aircraft, such as the famous IL-2 “Sturmovik” (“Bird of Prey”).
The successor to the IL-2, the Su-25—nicknamed the “Grach” (“Rook”) by Soviet aviators—saw heavy use in Afghanistan. In an effort to break the stalemate developing in the Fulda Gap, Soviet commanders commit two squadrons of Su-25s to sup- port a morning attack by the 79th Guards Tank and 57th Guards Motor Rifle Divisions.

RS21: Breakthrough Background After almost two weeks of fighting, the NATO front in central Germany begins to crack. Soviet second echelon forces pour through the gaps in several sectors. In an effort to give ground troops time to retreat and regroup, NATO air forces launch massed strike raids into “kill boxes” where Soviet tanks are running wild. Soviet air defense troops desperately try to keep up with the advancing forces but there are critical gaps in the SAM and AAA coverage.
Targets For each NATO Bombing Raid, roll to determine which Soviet division will be its target. No more than one raid per division.
Raid flights must target armor and mech units of their assigned division target. See SSR1.

WP Pilot Quality USSR: 1 Ace, 2-4 Veteran, 5-10 Regular; GDR: 1 Veteran, 2-4 Regular, 5-10 Trained Scenario Special Rules 1. NATO Bombing flights do not follow a flight path in this scenario. Instead, each Bombing flight must move so it can attack two identified (see SSR 2) WP Armor or Mech units in its assigned target division. Each flight may make as many bombing runs as desired on the two target units, but no other ground targets may be attacked. Bombing flights must abort after all air-to-ground ordnance is expended.
2. Bombing flights may only conduct an air-to-ground attack on a WP Armor or Mech unit of their target division that has been “identified” by a NATO Fast FAC flight. All WP Army Ground units begin “unidentified.”
3. During each SAM Location Phase, a non-disordered Fast FAC flight may attempt to identify two WP Armor or Mech units in the flight’s forward or beam arcs. The attempt requires the flight to be within two hexes and have a line of sight to the ground unit. It succeeds on a roll of 5 or less (+1 DRM in Rough, +1 DRM LOS through Broken Cloud or Mist/Haze, +1 DRM if FAC aircraft has crew of one). Once identified, a WP Army Ground unit remains identified for the remainder of the scenario. Make a side note of identified WP Army Ground units, rotate them, or mark them with an unused counter.
4. Fast FAC flights are immune from Aborts due to random events. They automatically have an Aggression Value of +2. They may only carry IRM and Gun air-to-air weapons if otherwise allowed.
5. Safe Passage Corridors. The NATO and WP players may each plot one Safe Passage Corridor [15.43].
6. If it does not finish earlier, the scenario ends after Turn 20.
At that point, roll for recovery for all flights that have not yet recovered.

With bad weather closing in, NATO commanders decide to commit their massive B-52 bombers to hammer the advancing Soviet units. The BUFFs and a large group of SEAD, jamming, and escort fighters form up in the inky darkness over the Ruhr Valley and head toward the front in a desperate effort to knock out the advancing Soviet reinforcements.
Targets The NATO player selects six units from the 15th Guards Tank Division and six units from the 1st Guards Motor Rifle Division.
Each B-52 flight must be allocated to attack two of these targets.

Raid target VP are assessed as follows: Slight Damage (2VP), Heavy Damage (3VP), De- stroyed (4VP). Use the NATO Victory Level Table [32.2].
RS23: Bridge Busting Background After the Warsaw Pact breakthrough on May 18th, NATO ground units are still attempting to form a solid defensive line but need time. WP supply lines depend on a few highway bridges and numerous temporary bridges over the Werra, Fulda, and Leine rivers to support their exploiting troops. NATO planners want these bridges taken out whatever the cost, leading NATO air commanders to decide that a night attack has the highest chance of success against these heavily defended targets.
Targets The NATO player rolls on the Target Table below until four different raid targets are designated. Two are allocated to each Deep Strike Raid. Each target hex includes two bridge spans [18.23] that must be attacked separately.

RS25: Day of Days Background After weeks of non-stop combat, Warsaw Pact ground forces pause to consolidate gains and to prepare for resuming the of- fensive. On the 43rd anniversary of the D-Day landings, NATO tries to take advantage of this pause to fly in desperately needed reinforcements in the form of the US 82nd Airborne Division.
Tipped off by intelligence sources, WP commanders attempt to “ambush” the lumbering transports on their way to airfields in and around Frankfurt using a mass raid of fighter aircraft. A confused night melee ensues, with NATO fighter aircraft and SAMs trying to keep a surge of WP fighters at bay long enough to get the transports on the ground.
Targets The NATO player rolls for each of the six C-141 flights to determine its destination airfield. No more than 2 flights may have the same destination.

2. WP flights get a +10 on their Morale Check rolls for any air-to-air combats with C-141 flights.
3. Air Transport Raids. The NATO player must create a flight path [8.31] for each C-141 flight. C-141 flights follow their flight path to their target airfield as if they were Bombing flights. This flight path must include the designated airfield where the flight must land (at Wiesbaden or Rhein-Main) or drop paratroopers (at Finthen, Friedberg, or Giessen).
● C-141 flights may land normally [9.14] at Wiesbaden and Rhein-Main. Once landed they may not be attacked in any way. To successfully drop paratroopers at Finthen, Friedberg, or Giessen, each C-141 flight must pass through the airfield hex at Low altitude at speed 2. Damaged aircraft may still drop paratroopers; Crippled aircraft may not. C-141 flights that dropped paratroopers may egress from the west, north or south edge and automatically recover successfully (even if Damaged or Crippled).
● C-141 flights ignore Abort [8.4] Morale Check or random event results and instead become Disordered. A C-141 flight with a Crippled aircraft may split the flight [4.14] so that the Crippled aircraft is alone in the new flight (a second non-Crippled aircraft is not required to join it). C-141 flights may continue with their mission if Disordered [13.11]. If engaged in air-to-air combat, they must try to disengage [11.41].

In addition, the NATO player receives 2VP for each individual C-141 aircraft that lands or successfully drops paratroopers at its target airfield. Use the NATO Victory Level Table [32.2].
RS26: Belgian Barrage Background A month of high-intensity air combat has worn down the air forces on both sides. The Belgian Air Force, whose bases have not been attacked by Warsaw Pact strikes, is becoming an in- creasingly important part of NATO’s efforts to maintain sortie rates high enough to deal with the surge of WP reserve aircraft squadrons that begin operating several weeks into the conflict.
This scenario features Belgian Air Force aircraft providing air support to NATO ground troops.

Victory Conditions Standard Victory Points [32.1] are in effect. Do not use the WP or NATO Victory Level Tables [32.2]. Instead, at the end of the scenario, compare both sides’ VP counts. If one side’s total exceeds the other by 10+ VP, that side wins. Otherwise, the scenario is a draw.
RS27: High Speed Recon Background As both sides begin preparations for possible nuclear escalation, reconnaissance of the enemy’s nuclear storage sites and launch- ers becomes ever more critical. With many space systems taken offline by anti-satellite weapons, Warsaw Pact commanders risk high-value intelligence collection aircraft deeper and deeper into NATO controlled airspace. Taking advantage of a break in the weather, they assemble a select force of MiG-25 Foxbat aircraft in the hopes that the high speeds and high altitudes where they operate will allow them to collect the intelligence they need on American Pershing II missiles, nuclear weapon storage sites, and critical headquarters.
Targets The reconnaissance targets for this mission are Pershing II (Missile units) and warhead storage facilities/HQs (HQ units) in NATO rear areas. The WP player rolls on the Target Table below until six different recon targets are designated. These are the primary raid recon targets.

RS28: Special Weapons Background After almost a month of combat, NATO has finally been able to stabilize the front in West Germany. Frustrated Warsaw Pact commanders ask for the release of tactical nuclear weapons to break the stalemate. In an effort to limit escalation, WP com- manders plan strikes with air-delivered low-yield weapons against NATO support unit targets near the front. RN-40 tacti- cal nuclear bombs are quietly removed from special storage bunkers across East Germany. However, NATO detects the WP preparations and puts up a strong line of American and Canadian Combat Air Patrol and SEAD flights with jamming support.
They have orders to cross the front and engage the WP raid as far east as possible.
Targets The WP player selects eight raid targets. Each target must be an HQ, Supply, or Missile unit. Each target must be assigned to one WP Bombing flight.

WP Su-24 flights tasked with Bombing may only carry 1 Nuke point, IRM, and Guns. Plot a full flight path [8.31] for each individual flight as if they were separate raids. Each flight may only attack its assigned target hex. The four WP Su-24 flights tasked with SEAD may carry a maximum of eight total Kh-58 shots between them.
2. In an exception to [12.21], WP aircraft carrying Nuke ordnance are not required to jettison their bomb load if Damaged (they still must if they are Crippled). They may still conduct air-to-ground attacks with Nuke ordnance if Damaged. They are immune from Aborts due to random events or Morale Checks from SAM/AAA attacks.
3. Safe Passage Corridors. The NATO and WP players may each plot two Safe Passage Corridors [15.43].
4. All Nuke points are RN-40 bombs that were only 30 kilotons in size. In an exception to [17.67], they do not damage ground units or aircraft in hexes adjacent to the target hex. Units/ flights in the target hex are affected normally.
5. All Kh-58 ARMs [17.57] have small nuclear warheads. Apply a +8 modifier on the Air-to-Ground Damage Table. However, do not place a Nuke Attack marker or apply any other Nuke [17.67] effects.
Victory Conditions Standard Victory Points [32.1] are in effect. Instead of normal raid target VP, the WP player receives 5VP for each target hex with a Nuclear Attack marker at the end of the scenario.
Regardless of the VP totals, the NATO side wins an automatic Decisive Victory if no Su-24s are able to successfully deliver their Nuke points on target.
RS29: 99 Red Balloons Background After the initial exchange of tactical nuclear weapons near the front does little to change the bloody stalemate, Warsaw Pact commanders secure permission to hit bigger targets deep in West Germany. Planners target dozens of air-delivered nuclear weapons at critical airfields, logistics nodes, and HQs in the German III Corps and US V Corps sectors of the front. NATO air defenses have been slowly ground down over the last month, but NATO air commanders send up everything they have left.
Targets The raid targets for this scenario are the five Pershing Missile units, the five HQ units, and ten of the NATO airfields (WP player’s choice) on/west of hex column 19xx (twenty targets to- tal). At least one flight armed with Nuke points must be assigned to each target. In addition to the raid targets, AS-6 and AS-15 flights may target located Nike-Hercules or Patriot SAM units.

10. NATO flights get a +10 on their Morale Check rolls for any air-to-air combats with AS-6 or AS-15 flights.
Victory Conditions Standard Victory Points [32.1] are in effect, except instead of normal VP for raid targets the WP player receives 2.5VP for each of the twenty target hexes with a Nuclear Attack marker at the end of the scenario. Use the WP Victory Level Table [32.2].
RS30: The Final Countdown Background NATO absorbs a devastating barrage of nuclear weapons across West Germany. However, NATO commanders dispersed suf- ficient aircraft and weapons to hit back that same night against WP third echelon units and logistics infrastructure in East Ger- many and Poland. Will the barrage of nukes be enough to stop the Warsaw Pact advance once and for all?
Targets During the Raid Planning Phase, the NATO player selects twenty-four targets. Allowed targets include airfields, HQ, Missile, Supply, and Armor units in East Germany. The NATO player must plan to attack each target chosen with at least one Nuke point. In addition, the NATO player selects six “target” hexes on the east edge on/north of hexrow xx30 for the GLCM flights (one per flight). See SSR 1.

RSC1: Bombs on Target Background Soviet doctrine tasks Frontal Aviation regiments with control of the air over the front and delivery of large amounts of ord- nance on NATO support forces, primarily targeting artillery, air defense, command and control, supply, and airfields. Early in the war, Soviet air command organizes elements of several regiments into an Air Division to support the 8th Guards Army attack against the US 3rd Armored and 3rd Infantry Divisions.

WP Order of Battle Raid Planning The WP player must plan at least one morning Bombing raid (OOB Table I) per day but may plan two Bombing raids on two of the campaign days (one raid in the morning, one in the afternoon). Morning raids take place at 0700 and afternoon raids at 1500. Night raids are not allowed.
A planned Bombing raid may also have a Fighter Sweep (OOB H) planned to accompany it. No other types of raids may be planned. Each Bombing raid must have aircraft and flights as- signed to conduct all the tasks listed on OOB Table I. The WP player is free to assign any aircraft type to the various tasks.
However, each task in the raid must be conducted by one type of aircraft. Each individual flight in the raid must consist of aircraft from the same squadron.
Raid targets are limited to targets on the campaign Target Table and located Patriot and/or HAWK SAMs on/east of hex column 26xx. Recon targets are limited to raid targets for the current raid or targets from previous raids still marked with an Attack Success marker. Each raid may have up to four raid targets.
For each Bombing raid add, the WP player must add, if possible: 2 x {2} Su-17M3, Recon. The WP player may choose to add 1 x {1} Yak-28PP, Escort Jamming and/or 1 x {1} An-12PP, Standoff Jamming to each raid. In all cases, these flights may not be added if there are not sufficient Combat Ready aircraft to create them. Escort Jamming flights enter normally. Standoff Jamming flights may set up on-map at start, at least ten hexes from the Front.
Do not roll for ordnance availability. Instead, draw PGMs from the PGM stocks from the flight’s base.
All raids ingress/egress from east edge hexes on/north of hexrow xx32. For each raid, the WP player may designate two Rally Points within five hexes of the Front.

5 NATO Counter-Air Success. Randomly select one WP squadron. Aircraft from that squadron may not participate in any raids the next day.
6 WP Breakthrough. Rapid WP progress around Han- nover pulls away NATO air cover. Reduce NATO AAP by 15.
7+ No Event.
Victory Conditions Standard CVP awards for campaign scenarios apply. Subtract total NATO VP from WP VP to determine the final victory total: VP Diff Victory Level 88+ Decisive Victory. NATO rear areas in V Corps are severely damaged and NATO fighter cover is greatly weakened. Soviet ground forces rapidly advance toward Frankfurt.
80-87 Victory. Attacks have reduced NATO support assets significantly. NATO fighter cover degraded.
64-79 Inconclusive Operations. Overall WP objectives were not achieved. New units will have to be rotated in to hit the same target area.
43-63 Defeat. NATO air defense operations are a success.
The WP air offensive does not significantly hurt NATO ground or air capabilities. < 43 Significant Defeat. NATO defense holds. Minimal impact on NATO operations. NATO declares they “own the skies” over central Germany.
RSC2: Eyes on Target Background Soviet operational doctrine requires a constant flow of new units into the front to grind down and break through NATO defenses.
Tactical reconnaissance operations are a critical element of NATO’s plans to identify, attack, and stop these second and third echelon WP ground forces. After two weeks of fighting, initial WP forces have largely been stopped. However, Category B reserve troops are moving to the front in order to regain the initiative and break through NATO lines. Several squadrons of NATO reconnaissance aircraft are tasked with finding and tracking their movements to enable deep strikes by other units.
Targets (Recon Campaign) Units of the 7th Guards Tank Army (Armor, Mech, Artillery, HQ, and Supply units) are the recon targets for the campaign.
For Recon raids, the NATO player may select any units from these formations as recon targets. Each individual unit may only be successfully reconnoitered (i.e., scored for VP) once during the campaign.

NATO Order of Battle Raid Planning The NATO player must complete a total of five raids in the cam- paign: two SEAD raids and three Recon raids. Two of these five raids may be conducted at night. On two days of the campaign, two raids may be conducted. On the other day, only one may be conducted. Morning raids take place at 0800, afternoon raids at 1400, and night raids at 2300.
SEAD Raids include the following: 8 x {2} [SEAD], SEAD; 4 x {2} [CAP], CAP; 1 x {1} [Standoff Jamming], Standoff Jamming; 3 x Dummy Flights. The NATO player may assign any available aircraft for these tasks, except SEAD flights in a particular raid must come from two or fewer different squadrons.
The targets for a SEAD Raid are not fixed in advance. Each flight tasked with SEAD may attack SAM, EWR, or AAA targets. All flights in SEAD Raids may set up on-map within two hexes of an Orbit Point. Flights may egress anywhere on the west edge.
SEAD Raids automatically end after 15 turns. At the end of Turn 15, roll to recover all flights.
Recon Raids include the following: 4 x {2} [Recon], Recon; 2 x {2} [SEAD], SEAD; 4 x {2} [CAP], CAP; 1 x {1} [Standoff Jamming], Standoff Jamming; 3 x Dummy Flights. The NATO player may assign any available aircraft for these tasks, except that all flights tasked with Recon in a particular raid must be from the same squadron. Designate ingress/egress hexes for the Recon Raid on the west edge.
For both types of raids, the NATO player may designate two Orbit Points at least ten hexes west of the Front, two Rally Points within five hexes of the Front, and two Safe Passage Corridors [15.43].

During the scenario, WP SAMs may not voluntarily shutdown their radars in the Admin Phase. If shut down due to an ARM launch (voluntarily or not), Suppression, or SEAD Table result, WP SAMs must attempt to turn their radars back on as soon as possible.
2. WP Divisional SAMs. All SA-8, SA-11, and SA-13 SAMs that initially set up within two hexes of the 20th Guards, 9th Tank, 27th Guards, and 79th Guards Tank Divisions must set up within two hexes of a unit of their associated division throughout the campaign.
Campaign Random Events Roll Event 1 WP Reinforcements. The WP player adds 10 AAP to the WP AAP total.

6 WP Breakthrough. Rapid WP progress around Han- nover pulls away WP air assets. Reduce WP AAP by 15.
7+ No Event.
Victory Conditions Standard CVP awards for campaign scenarios apply. Subtract total NATO VP from WP VP to determine the final victory total: VP Diff Victory Level 69+ Decisive Victory. WP second echelon divisions are seriously damaged, leading to 1st Guards Tank Army canceling its planned offensive.
53-68 Victory. WP second echelon forces reduced and delayed.
43-52 Inconclusive Operations. Overall NATO objec- tives were not achieved. Reconnaissance is not sufficient to support deep interdiction operations as planned.
24-42 Defeat. WP air defense operations are a success.
The second echelon forces reach the front on schedule. < 24 Significant Defeat. Second echelon units arrive and attack successfully, leading to a breakthrough.
RS Solo Scenario A: CAS Background NATO ground commanders constantly call for help to stall multiple strong Warsaw Pact armor attacks. NATO air forces create task forces of close air support aircraft designed to go low and slow to kill tanks and front line air defense units. They are rushed to areas of the front where they are needed most, in this case the US VII Corps sector, where the newly arrived East Ger- man 4th and 11th Mechanized Divisions are attacking in force.
Targets For each NATO CAS group, roll to determine its target group.
Each CAS group must have a different Target Group. Within the Target Group, flights may select multiple targets. See SSR3.
Roll Target Group 1-3 GDR 4th Mechanized Division Mech & Armor units 4-5 GDR 4th Mechanized Division Air Defense units 6-8 GDR 11th Mechanized Division Mech & Armor units 9-10 GDR 11th Mechanized Division Air Defense units GDR 4th Mechanized Division targets are those on/west of hex column 67xx.

● Corps/Army SAM Zone = NA for this scenario
● Max SAM types allowed (including SAMs setting up located at start): ○ SA-6 (6), SA-8 (5), SA-11 (3), SA-13 (6) AAA Activation Information:
● 8 x Light AAA, inactive, in the following locations: 5936, 6137, 6238, 6539, 6840, 7039, 7339, 7437
● Roll: 1-4 2K22, 5-8 Light AAA Concentration, 9-10 Light AAA Concentration + Fire Can.
● Max types/number allowed: 4 x 2K22, 4 x Light AAA, 2 x Fire Can Scenario Special Rules 1. This is a Large scenario. For SEAD purposes, ISR condition is Average.
2. During the Raid Planning Phase, generate two NATO CAS Raids. For each raid, make the following rolls:
● Roll 1d10 for raid nationality: 1-6 US; 7-9 FRG; 10 CAN.
● Roll 1d10 for the raid aircraft type: ○ US: 1-7 A-10A; 7-9 A-7D; 10 F-4D ○ FRG: 1-5 Alpha Jet; 6-10 F-4F ○ CAN: 1-5 CF-5A; 6-10 CF-18A.
● Roll for ordnance available for each flight on OOB Table C.
3. NATO Bombing flights do not follow a flight path in this scenario. Instead, each Bombing flight must move so it can attack two identified (see SSR 4) WP units of the assigned type in its assigned target division. Each flight may make as many bombing runs as desired on the two target units, but no other ground targets may be attacked. Bombing flights must Abort after all air-to-ground ordnance is expended.
4. Bombing flights may only conduct an air-to-ground attack on a WP unit (either Armor/Mech or air defense units based on the Target Group Table) of their target division that has been “identified” by a NATO Fast FAC flight. All WP units begin “unidentified.” The F-4G SEAD flight is not under this restriction and may attack normally.
5. During each SAM Location Phase, after normal SAM location attempts, a non-disordered Fast FAC flight may attempt to identify two WP units (Armor, Mech, SAMs, Fire Can, 2K22) in the flight’s forward or beam arcs. The attempt requires the flight to be within two hexes, Deck or Low altitude, and have a line of sight to the unit. Roll 1d10.
Identification succeeds on a roll of 5 or more (-1 DRM in Rough, -1 DRM LOS through Broken Cloud or Haze, -1 DRM FAC with crew of one, +3 DRM target marked with SAM Launch or Radar AAA Fired). Once identified, a WP unit remains identified for the remainder of the scenario.
6. Fast FAC flights are immune from Aborts due to random events. They automatically have an Aggression Value of +2.
They may only carry IRM and Gun air-to-air weapons.
7. Random Events “WP QRA” and “NATO QRA” are NA for this scenario.
8. If it does not finish earlier, the scenario ends after Turn 20.
At that point, roll for recovery for all flights that have not yet recovered.
Victory Conditions Standard Victory Points [32.1] are in effect, except the NATO player scores raid target VP as follows: Destroyed (4VP), Heavy Damage (3VP), Slight Damage (2VP). Use the NATO Victory Level Table [32.2].
RS Solo Scenario B: Fighter Sweep Background On the afternoon of 15 May 1987 hundreds of Soviet and East German aircraft takeoff in rapid succession and push toward the border at supersonic speeds. With NATO expecting an opening attack on its airbases, the Warsaw Pact planners instead plan to surprise NATO airmen with a mass fighter sweep in an effort to knock out as many NATO fighters as possible on the opening day of the war. They count on surprise, and numbers, to overcome NATO technical advantages.
Scenario Conditions
● Date: 15 May 1987
● Time of Day: 1600 (Day)
● Player Sides: The Human player is the WP player. The Bot player is the NATO player.
● Scenario Size: Large
● Detection Level: NATO: C WP: B
● Weather: Clear. Do not roll on the Weather Table.
● Map: The entire map is in play.
● The Front: NATO side is on/west of 6302-6309-5314-5316- 5718-5721-5522-5531-5631-5633-6940-6935-7538-7737.
The WP side is east of that line.
● Closed Airfields: None
● Inherent AAA/IR SAM Coverage: NATO side within seven hexes of the Front
● ISR: Neither side
● SEAD: Neither side
● Early Warning: Neither side. Surprise Attack condition for both sides.
● NATO Air Defense Zone: 2ATAF/4ATAF
● NATO Flight Restriction: NATO flights may not move (they are locked in their setup hexes, at Deck altitude) until a detected WP flight occupies a hex on/west of the Front.
The instant that occurs, begin drawing chits for NATO flight movement and follow normal bot flight movement actions. “Locked” NATO flights may be detected normally but may not be attacked in air-to-air combat.
● NATO Zone Limit: NATO flights may not voluntarily move within five hexes of the Front. Adjust movement actions to remain at least five hexes from the Front.
● WP Flight Restrictions: Once on the NATO side of the Front, each WP flight must maintain a heading of due west at High altitude until the instant the flight is within ten hexes of a detected NATO flight, or they are engaged themselves in air-to-air combat (including BVR combat [11]). If neither of these conditions occur, once the WP flight moves on/west of hex column xx40 this restriction is lifted and the flight may move freely.
● Setup Order: NATO is first.
NATO Order of Battle Air Setup Air Units and Markers:
● Set up four randomly selected generic flights, with two facing north at Low altitude and two facing south at Low altitude (randomly determine which ones), adjacent to each of the four NATO Orbit Points (sixteen total generic flights).

WP Pilot Quality USSR (MiG-29/Su-25/Su-27) = Veteran, USSR (other) = Regu- lar, GDR = Trained Scenario Special Rules 1. This scenario ends at the end of Turn 15. At that point, roll for recovery for all flights that have not yet recovered.
2. Bot flights that land due to Winchester status may rearm/ refuel [9.16] and takeoff again.
Victory Conditions Standard Victory Points [32.1] are in effect. In addition, the WP player receives 20VP if, at the end of Turn 15, all NATO flights are Disordered, Aborted, Landed, or Recovered off-map prior to the Recovery Phase. Also, if the NATO Bot player shoots down at least four WP aircraft and has a 3:1 or better kill ratio, the NATO Bot player receives an additional 10VP. Use the WP Victory Level Table [32.2].
RS Solo Scenario C: HAWK Belt Background Warsaw Pact suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) doc- trine differed substantially from NATO’s approach. Rather than NATO’s “precision” SEAD concept, WP plans require a “mass” approach that includes an extensive chaff laying and jamming effort combined with artillery and anti-radiation missile barrages.
The goal of the WP air forces is to create “sanitized corridors” approximately 50 km wide and 200 km deep to allow follow- up deep strikes into NATO’s rear areas. On the first full day of the war, Soviet commanders put these plans in motion, with an initial wave of SEAD aircraft backed by heavy jamming support targeting NATO HAWK sites behind the front.
Targets The WP targets for this mission are four NATO HAWK sites in the NATO 2ATAF zone. The WP player must allocate at least one Bombing flight to each target.
Target Hex HAWK C 4404 HAWK C 4408 HAWK D 4013 HAWK D 4512 HAWK target hexes include the following sub-targets, which must be targeted separately. Also see SSR 2: Target Profile Command Center B Launchers C Fire Control Radar D Scenario Conditions

WP Pilot Quality USSR (MiG-29/Su-25/Su-27) = Veteran, USSR (other) = Regu- lar, GDR = Trained Scenario Special Rules 1. This is a Large scenario. Only SAMs on/east of hex column 40xx may be checked for activation during the ISR Phase.
No pre-game SEAD attacks are allowed.
2. HAWK Sites as targets.
● Damage from ARM attacks on HAWK sites are applied only to the Fire Control Radar sub-target in the hex. Other sub-targets (Launchers, etc.) are not affected by ARM attacks.
● If an Attack Success marker is placed on any sub-target in the hex, check for target damage [18.1] immediately.
A Slight result on any of the sub-targets suppresses the SAM [18.2] for 1d10 turns. A Heavy or Total Destruction damage result on any of the three sub-targets in the hex requires the SAM to shutdown for the remainder of the scenario. Place a SAM Damage marker as a reminder.
● AP/AT Cluster Bomb Units [17.61] and Rockets [17.63] attack the launcher and fire control radar at double strength and the command bunker at one-quarter strength. KMGU [17.66] attack the launcher and fire control radar at triple strength and the command bunker at half strength. Other ordnance types attack sub-targets at normal strength.
3. Pre-Game Chaff Laying. As part of the Air Deployment Phase, the WP player may place one bloomed chaff corridor [19.4], on/east of hex column 48xx.
4. Bot flights that land due to Winchester status may rearm/ refuel [9.16] and takeoff again.
